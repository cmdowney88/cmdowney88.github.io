					<h1>Course Description</h1>
					<p class="lead">
						This course addresses linguistic research questions through data science
						techniques. The course will focus on developing skills to (i) acquire and
						process a variety of language data &mdash; from using established corpora to
						data "in the wild" from the internet &mdash; and (ii) to investigate
						language use through exploratory data analysis techniques and inferential
						statistics. This course will introduce a range of tools for working with
						linguistic data, such as Unix commands, Python, NLTK, NumPy, Pandas, R, and
						ggplot. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to applying
						these tools and skills in hands-on projects.

					<h1>Policies</h1>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Homework</h2>
					<p>
						Students will complete 6-8 homeworks, comprised of both written questions
						and small programming assignments. All homework will be submitted via
						Blackboard. Homeworks will be worth 40% of the total grade.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Projects</h2>
					<p>
						Students will complete one midterm and one final project. The midterm
						project will be worth 20% and the final project 30% of the final grade.
						These projects will be larger and more open-ended than the homeworks,
						prompting students to apply data analysis techniques to real-world language
						data, and write up the results.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Deadlines and late work</h2>
					<p>
						All deadlines and meeting times for this class are in "Eastern Time".
						<strong>Please note:</strong> on Sunday March 9, this will change from
						Eastern Standard Time (EST/UTC-5) to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT/UTC-4). All
						work should be submitted by 11:00pm the day it is due. Work that is
						received late will incur the following penalties:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Up to 1 hour late: 5%</li>
						<li>Up to 24 hours late: 10%</li>
						<li>Up to 48 hours late: 20%</li>
						<li>Later than 48 hours: not graded (0 for the assignment)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Extensions (without penalty) may be offered if they are requested within a
						reasonable amount of time (relative to the reason for the extension) before
						the work is due. Please don't hesitate to ask for an extension if you need
						one.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Attendance and participation</h2>
					<p>
						Because of the hands-on nature of this class, both attendance and
						participation are important. <strong>I will keep track of class
						attendance</strong>. Students are allowed to be absent from up to four
						sessions for any reason, without needing to contact me, and without penalty.
						These excused absences may be used for travel, illness, catching up with
						other courses, etc. However, unexecused absences beyond these four sessions
						will count against the student's final attendance grade, with the exception
						of important obligations listed below. Attendance will be worth 5% of the
						final grade.
					</p>
					<p>
						Much of class time will be devoted to live demonstrations of software tools
						that students are encouraged to follow along with, as well as "workshop"
						days during which students will be given time to work on their projects and
						receive live feedback from the instructor. Becuase of this,
						<strong>students are expected to bring a laptop or other device to each
						class</strong>, on which they can develop and test data-intensive software.
						Please contact me as soon as possible if you do not have an appropriate
						device. Participation will be worth 5% of the final grade.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Final grading</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>40%: homework assignments</li>
						<li>30%: final project</li>
						<li>20%: midterm project</li>
						<li>5%: attendance</li>
						<li>5%: participation</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Exceptions</h2>
					<p>
						Students will not be penalized because of important civic, ethnic, family or
						religious obligations, or university service. You will have a chance,
						whenever feasible, to make up within a reasonable time any assignment that
						is missed for these reasons. Absences for these reasons will count as
						excused for the sake of the participation grade. But it is your job to
						inform me of any expected missed work in advance, as soon as possible.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Academic honesty</h2>
					<p>
						All assignments and activities associated with this course must be performed
						in accordance with the University of Rochester's Academic Honesty Policy.
						More information is available
						<a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty" target="_blank">here</a>.
						<strong>Please note:</strong> The use of Generative AI to produce any part
						of written/essay (prose) assignments is <strong>not allowed</strong>.
						Students may use Generative AI to assist in <strong>programming only</strong>.
						However, students are fully responsible for the success or failure of their
						code.
