					<h1>Course Description</h1>
					<p class="lead">
						How do you go from raw linguistic data to a scientific conclusion? This
						course bridges that gap. Students will work hands-on with the data formats
						linguists actually encounter&mdash;corpora, treebanks, speech recordings,
						annotation schemes&mdash;and learn to process, explore, and analyze them.
						Topics include text processing with Python and NLTK, version control with
						Git, and statistical analysis with R. The course culminates in a term
						project where students investigate a linguistic research question using
						real data.
					</p>

					<h2 class="pt-2">Prerequisites</h2>
					<p>
						Basic experience with Python programming is recommended. Students without
						prior Python experience should be prepared to do additional work early in
						the semester to get up to speed.

					<h1>Policies</h1>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Homework</h2>
					<p>
						Students will complete several homeworks comprised of both written
						questions and programming assignments. All homework will be submitted via
						Blackboard. Homeworks will be worth 20% of the total grade.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Midterm Project</h2>
					<p>
						Students will complete a midterm project involving a structured data
						processing task. This project will have precise specifications and is
						designed to give students hands-on experience working with linguistic
						data formats covered in the first half of the course. The midterm
						project is worth 20% of the final grade.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Term Project</h2>
					<p>
						Students will complete a substantial term project applying data science
						techniques from this course to a linguistic research question of their
						choosing. Projects may be completed individually or in pairs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your project should investigate a <strong>research question</strong>
						about language using real data. This could involve exploring patterns
						in a corpus, analyzing phonetic measurements, comparing annotation
						schemes, or testing a hypothesis about language use. The key is that
						you're using data to answer a question—not just demonstrating a
						technique.
					</p>
					<p>
						Deliverables include a final presentation to the class and a writeup
						describing your research question, data, methods, and findings. Progress
						will be tracked through milestones throughout the semester (see schedule
						for dates; detailed requirements for each milestone will be linked there).
					</p>
					<h3>Example Project Directions</h3>
					<p>
						These illustrate the form of a valid project, not prescribed topics:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Analyze syntactic patterns in a treebank to test a hypothesis about word order</li>
						<li>Compare formant distributions across dialects using speech recordings</li>
						<li>Investigate lexical diversity or sentiment in a specialized corpus</li>
						<li>Explore annotation consistency across different tagging schemes</li>
						<li>Conduct a corpus study replicating or extending a published finding</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The term project is worth 40% of the final grade.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Deadlines and late work</h2>
					<p>
						All deadlines and meeting times for this class are in "Eastern Time".
						<strong>Please note:</strong> on Sunday March 8, this will change from
						Eastern Standard Time (EST/UTC-5) to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT/UTC-4). All
						work should be submitted by 11:00pm the day it is due. Work that is
						received late will incur the following penalties:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Up to 1 hour late: 5%</li>
						<li>Up to 24 hours late: 10%</li>
						<li>Up to 48 hours late: 20%</li>
						<li>Later than 48 hours: not graded (0 for the assignment)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Extensions (without penalty) may be offered if they are requested within a
						reasonable amount of time (relative to the reason for the extension) before
						the work is due. Please don't hesitate to ask for an extension if you need
						one.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Attendance</h2>
					<p>
						Because of the hands-on nature of this class, attendance is important.
						<strong>I will keep track of class attendance</strong>. Students are
						allowed to be absent from up to two sessions for any reason, without
						needing to contact me, and without penalty. These excused absences may be
						used for travel, illness, catching up with other courses, etc. However,
						unexcused absences beyond these two sessions will count against the
						student's final attendance grade, with the exception of important
						obligations listed below. Attendance will be worth 10% of the final grade.
					</p>
					<p>
						Much of class time will be devoted to demonstrations and hands-on
						exercises, as well as workshop days during which students will work on
						their projects and receive feedback from the instructor. Because of this,
						<strong>students are expected to bring a laptop or other device to each
						class</strong>, on which they can develop and test data-intensive software.
						Please contact me as soon as possible if you do not have an appropriate
						device.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Participation</h2>
					<p>
						Participation will be worth 10% of the final grade, based on:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Engagement in in-class activities and discussions</li>
						<li>Completion of periodic check-in surveys</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Final grading</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>40%: term project</li>
						<li>20%: midterm project</li>
						<li>20%: homework assignments</li>
						<li>10%: attendance</li>
						<li>10%: participation</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Exceptions</h2>
					<p>
						Students will not be penalized because of important civic, ethnic, family or
						religious obligations, or university service. You will have a chance,
						whenever feasible, to make up within a reasonable time any assignment that
						is missed for these reasons. Absences for these reasons will count as
						excused for the sake of the participation grade. But it is your job to
						inform me of any expected missed work in advance, as soon as possible.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Academic honesty</h2>
					<p>
						All assignments and activities associated with this course must be performed
						in accordance with the University of Rochester's Academic Honesty Policy.
						More information is available
						<a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty" target="_blank">here</a>.
						<strong>Please note:</strong> The use of <strong>Generative AI</strong> to
						produce written assignments or project reports/writeups is <strong>not
						allowed</strong>. Generative AI is <strong>allowed for programming
						only</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This policy operates on the honor system. The goal of this course is for
						you to develop real expertise that you'll need for research, job interviews,
						and your career. If you outsource your thinking to AI, you mostly
						shortchange yourself. That said, there's a difference between having AI
						produce your work and using AI as a tool to help you learn. Using AI to
						clarify a concept, explore an idea, or deepen your understanding is fine.
						Using it to generate text or analysis that you then submit as your own is
						not.
