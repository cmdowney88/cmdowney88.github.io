					<h1>Course Description</h1>
					<p class="lead">
						Many Machine Learning courses assume you have access to large, labeled
						datasets. But what happens when you don't? Real-world applications
						routinely face severe data constraints: rare diseases have few documented
						cases, new products lack historical data, endangered species have limited
						observations, and most of the world's languages have minimal digital
						resources. How can we build effective ML systems when data is scarce?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						This course will introduce state-of-the-art techniques for data-efficient
						Machine Learning, focusing on three core areas: (1) transfer learning and
						domain adaptation, (2) learning with limited supervision (semi-supervised,
						self-supervised, and active learning), and (3) few-shot learning and data
						augmentation strategies. Students will engage with recent research
						literature and gain hands-on experience applying these methods across
						diverse domains.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Assessment is based on a substantial term project where students implement
						and evaluate data-efficient techniques on a problem of their choosing,
						along with smaller assignments throughout the semester.

					<h1>Grading and Policies</h1>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Attendance</h2>
					<p>
						Class attendance and participation are expected and count towards your grade.
						I will keep track of attendance. Students are allowed to be absent from up
						to two sessions for any reason, without needing to contact me, and without
						penalty. These excused absences may be used for travel, illness, catching up
						with other courses, etc. However, unexcused absences beyond these two
						sessions will count against the student's final attendance grade, with the
						exception of important obligations listed below.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Student-led Discussions</h2>
					<p>
						This course has a seminar component. Each Tuesday starting in Week 3,
						students will lead discussions on papers related to the previous Thursday's
						lecture topic. This format gives you the weekend to read and prepare after
						hearing the lecture.
					</p>
					<h3>Format</h3>
					<p>
						Each discussion session features two presenters, each leading approximately
						30-35 minutes of class time. The exact number of presentations per student
						will depend on final enrollment and will be announced after the add/drop
						period. With typical enrollment, expect to present 2-3 times during the
						semester.
					</p>
					<h3>Paper Selection</h3>
					<p>
						You will choose a research paper related to the week's topic. Papers must
						be approved at least one week before your presentation, and shared with
						the class by the Friday before so classmates can read it.
						<strong>You are encouraged to select papers from your own area of
						interest</strong>—this is an opportunity to explore how data-efficient
						ML applies to problems you care about.
					</p>
					<h3>Presentation Expectations</h3>
					<p>
						Your presentation should:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Prepare visual materials</strong>: Create slides or a handout
							to help the class follow your presentation. This should include key
							points, figures from the paper, and your discussion questions.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Summarize the paper</strong>: Explain the problem, methods,
							and key results so that classmates who haven't read it can follow.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Connect to course material</strong>: Relate the paper to
							concepts from the lecture and readings.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Offer your perspective</strong>: What are the paper's
							strengths and limitations? What questions does it raise?
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Facilitate discussion</strong>: Prepare 2-3 discussion
							questions to engage the class. Your role is not just to present,
							but to lead a conversation.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
					<p>
						Presentations will be graded on:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Clarity of explanation (Can we follow your summary?)</li>
						<li>Depth of understanding (Do you grasp the key ideas and methods?)</li>
						<li>Critical analysis (Can you identify strengths, weaknesses, and open questions?)</li>
						<li>Discussion facilitation (Did you engage the class in meaningful conversation?)</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Signup</h3>
					<p>
						After week 1, you will submit a form ranking your topic preferences. I will
						assign slots algorithmically to maximize preference satisfaction, with
						priority in later rounds going to students who received lower-ranked
						preferences earlier. Once assignments are posted, you may trade slots
						with another student if both parties email me to confirm.
					</p>

					<h2 class="pt-2">Term Project</h2>
					<p>
						You will complete a substantial term project applying data-efficient ML
						techniques from this course to an application area of your choice. Projects
						may be completed individually or in small groups (2-3 students). After
						the interest survey (M1), I will suggest potential groupings based on
						shared interests, but group formation is ultimately up to you. You are
						encouraged to choose an application domain you care about—whether that's
						NLP, medical imaging, climate science, robotics, or something else entirely.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your project must pose and test a <strong>scientific hypothesis</strong>:
						a specific, falsifiable prediction that your experiments can support or
						refute. For example: "Active learning will reduce annotation requirements
						by at least 40% compared to random sampling for task X," or "A model
						pre-trained on domain Y will outperform general pre-training when
						fine-tuned with limited labeled data from domain Y."
					</p>
					<p>
						Deliverables include a final presentation to the class, a GitHub repository
						with well-documented and reproducible code, and a writeup in the style of
						a research paper. Progress will be tracked through milestones spaced
						throughout the semester (see schedule below for dates and details).
					</p>
					<h3>Example Project Shapes</h3>
					<p>
						These are meant to illustrate the form of a valid project, not to prescribe
						specific topics:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Compare two semi-supervised methods on a low-resource task in your domain</li>
						<li>Measure how much active learning reduces annotation cost for a specific problem</li>
						<li>Investigate whether a particular augmentation strategy helps more for one data type than another</li>
						<li>Evaluate transfer learning from different source domains to your target task</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Late work</h2>
					<p>
						All deadlines are in Eastern Time. Work should be submitted by 11:00pm
						the day it is due. Late work incurs the following penalties:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Up to 1 hour late: 5%</li>
						<li>Up to 24 hours late: 10%</li>
						<li>Up to 48 hours late: 20%</li>
						<li>Later than 48 hours: not graded (0 for the assignment)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Extensions (without penalty) may be offered if they are requested within a
						reasonable amount of time (relative to the reason for the extension) before
						the work is due. Please don't hesitate to ask for an extension if you need
						one.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Final grading</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>45%: Term project</li>
						<li>30%: Student-led discussions</li>
						<li>25%: Participation (attendance + engagement in discussions)</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Exceptions</h2>
					<p>
						Students will not be penalized for civic, ethnic, family, or religious
						obligations, or university service. You will have a chance to make up
						missed work for these reasons. Please inform me in advance when possible.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pt-2">Academic honesty</h2>
					<p>
						All assignments and activities associated with this course must be performed
						in accordance with the University of Rochester's Academic Honesty Policy.
						More information is available
						<a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty" target="_blank">here</a>.
						<strong>Please note:</strong> The use of <strong>Generative AI</strong> to
						produce discussion presentations, project milestone reports, or the final
						writeup is <strong>not allowed</strong>. Generative AI is <strong>allowed
						for programming work on the Term Project only</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This policy operates on the honor system. The goal of this course is for
						you to develop real expertise that you'll need for research, job interviews,
						and your career. If you outsource your thinking to AI, you mostly
						shortchange yourself. That said, there's a difference between having AI
						produce your work and using AI as a tool to help you learn. Using AI to
						clarify a concept, explore an idea, or deepen your understanding is fine.
						Using it to generate text or analysis that you then submit as your own is
						not.
